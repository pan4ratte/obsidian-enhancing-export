# Changelog

## 1.0.0

### First release

* **Graphical export editor.** Every Pandoc option is a row in a settings dialog rather than a flag on a command line. Rows are shown only for the output formats that read them, so a template is never asked a question its writer would ignore.
* **Export templates.** Ready-made templates for Word, PDF, LaTeX, HTML, EPUB, Markdown and slide formats, each editable and duplicable. The resulting command line is shown at the foot of the editor and can be copied.
* **Lua filter store.** Browse, install and update Lua filters from a bundled catalogue, then switch them on per template. Filters that need no external program are marked as such before installation.
* **Obsidian-aware conversion.** Bundled filters resolve `![[embeds]]`, internal links, `$today`, and the keywords property, so a note exports as it reads in the vault.
* **Word and ODT styling.** Optional filters keep Pandoc from overriding a reference document's figure, table-cell and list styles.
* **Failure diagnostics.** A failed export reports the template, the target file, and a suggested next step for the errors the plugin recognises — a locked output file, a missing PDF engine, an absent LaTeX package, and others.
* **Pandoc dashboard.** Shows the detected Pandoc version, checks for updates, and links to the manual. The binary is auto-detected, or its folder can be set by hand.
